# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

This project focuses on regression analysis to predict medical insurance costs. I utilized several Python libraries, including NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn.

# Models Used:

KNeighborsRegressor

LinearRegression

XGBRegressor

DecisionTreeRegressor

RandomForestRegressor

Additionally, I conducted hyperparameter tuning for each model to enhance performance on validation and test datasets while minimizing the loss function.

# Dataset Overview

The dataset includes various features such as age, BMI, region, gender, and smoking status. These attributes help in predicting an individual's medical insurance cost accurately.
